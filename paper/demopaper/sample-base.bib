In this paper, we compare different TLS strategies using appropriate evaluation frameworks, and propose a simple and effective combination of methods that improves over the stateof-the-art on all tested benchmarks. For a more robust evaluation, we also present a new TLS dataset, which is larger and spans longer time periods than previous datasets.",

We also introduce a quantitative evaluation measure for MTLS based on previousTLS evaluation methods. Experimental results show that our MTLS framework demonstrates high effectiveness and MTLS task can give bet-ter results than TLS.}

Our system is entirely unsupervised, which makes it especially suited to TLS where there are very few gold summaries available for training of supervised systems. In addition, we present the first abstractive oracle experiments for TLS. Our system outperforms extractive competitors in terms of ROUGE when the number of input documents is high and the output requires strong compression. In these cases, our oracle experiments confirm that our approach also has a higher upper bound for ROUGE scores than extractive methods. A study with human judges shows that our abstractive system also produces output that is easy to read and understand.",

I base the study on a multiple newspaper corpora. I firstly perform a preliminary study to find out that the patterns appearing in future-reference sentences often consist of disjointed elements within a sentence. Such patterns are also usually semantically and grammatically consistent, although lexically variant. Therefore, I propose a method for automatic extraction of such patterns, applying both grammatical (morphological) and semantic information to represent sentences in morphosemantic structure, and then extract frequent patterns, including those with disjointed elements. Next, I perform a series of experiments, in which I firstly train fourteen classifier versions and compare them to choose the best one. Next, I compare my method to the state-of-the-art, and verify the final performance of the method on a new dataset. I conclude that the proposed method is capable to automatically classify future-reference sentences, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art, and reaching 76\% of F-score.},

Our goal is providing a search engine which can collect as many future/past events as possible relevant to user's query in obtaining various future scenarios considering both predictions and histories. Two technical issues are treated, (1) efficient search method for event information and (2) accurate filtering method for removing noises from search results. To search for event information effectively, our system expands a user query by some typical expressions related to event information such as year expressions, temporal modifiers and context terms. To remove noisy information, we selected five types of features for a machine learning technique to classify candidates into event information or not. Our experiment showed that filtering performance achieved an 85\% F-measure, and that query expansion can collect dozens of times more CEs than those without expansion.},

It is therefore difficult for users to manually compare and aggregate it, and to re-construct the most probable course of future events. In this paper we approach a problem of automatically generating summaries of future events related to queries using data obtained from news archive collections or from the Web. We propose two methods, explicit and implicit future-related information detection. The former is based on analyzing the context of future temporal expressions in documents, while the latter relies on detecting periodical patterns in historical document collections. We present a graph-based visualization of future-related information and demonstrate its usefulness through several examples.},

We propose a new task to address the problem of retrieving and ranking sentences that contain mentions to future events, which we call ranking related news predictions. In this paper, we formally define this task and propose a learning to rank approach based on 4 classes of features: term similarity, entity-based similarity, topic similarity, and temporal similarity. Through extensive evaluations using a corpus consisting of 1.8 millions news articles and 6,000 manually judged relevance pairs, we show that our approach is able to retrieve a significant number of relevant predictions related to a given topic.},
