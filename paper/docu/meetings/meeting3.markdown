# Meeting 3:

## Postprocessing Clusters:
- clustering led to having very **similar** sentences in the same cluster
  - same sentence, only slightly different structure, other word, â€¦
- this led to 'duplicate' info on the timeline or in the topic-section
- right now I use the SBERT embeddings that were fed to BERTopic and eliminate similar sentences like this:
  - [**0.7874, 0.77049**, 0.598494, **0.3454, 0.314950**] turns into
  - [**0.7874**, 0.598494, **0.3454**]

## Small Website to make Classification more convenient:
- can share with friends
- can do classification on my phone
- sentences are from news articles (requested without a specific topic)

I have already started with the *Data collection and preprocessing* section


## Visualizing Stats to Frontend:
- fraction of sentences with(out) temporal expressions (timeline)
- num clusters
- average sentences per cluster
