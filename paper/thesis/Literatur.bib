We focus on the future-related information which is grounded in time, that is, the information on forthcoming events whose expected occurrence dates are already known. We collect data by crawling search engine index and analyze collective view of future time-referenced events discussed on the web.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an on-demand search engine called ChronoSeeker, which allows users to find past/future events based on their interest. Our goal is providing a search engine which can collect as many future/past events as possible relevant to user's query in obtaining various future scenarios considering both predictions and histories. Two technical issues are treated, (1) efficient search method for event information and (2) accurate filtering method for removing noises from search results. To search for event information effectively, our system expands a user query by some typical expressions related to event information such as year expressions, temporal modifiers and context terms. To remove noisy information, we selected five types of features for a machine learning technique to classify candidates into event information or not. Our experiment showed that filtering performance achieved an 85\% F-measure, and that query expansion can collect dozens of times more CEs than those without expansion.},

  abstract = {In my doctoral dissertation I investigate patterns appearing in sentences referring to the future. Such patterns are useful in predicting future events. I base the study on a multiple newspaper corpora. I firstly perform a preliminary study to find out that the patterns appearing in future-reference sentences often consist of disjointed elements within a sentence. Such patterns are also usually semantically and grammatically consistent, although lexically variant. Therefore, I propose a method for automatic extraction of such patterns, applying both grammatical (morphological) and semantic information to represent sentences in morphosemantic structure, and then extract frequent patterns, including those with disjointed elements. Next, I perform a series of experiments, in which I firstly train fourteen classifier versions and compare them to choose the best one. Next, I compare my method to the state-of-the-art, and verify the final performance of the method on a new dataset. I conclude that the proposed method is capable to automatically classify future-reference sentences, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art, and reaching 76\% of F-score.},

  abstract = {Given a stream of Twitter messages about an event, we investigate the predictive power of features generated from words and temporal expressions in the messages to estimate the time to event (TTE). From labeled training data average TTE values of the predictive features are learned, so that when they occur in an event-related tweet the TTE estimate can be provided for that tweet. We utilize temporal logic rules and a historical context integration function to improve the TTE estimation precision. In experiments on football matches and music concerts we show that the estimates of the method are off by 4 and 10~h in terms of mean absolute error on average, respectively. We find that the type and size of the event affect the estimation quality. An out-of-domain test on music concerts shows that models and hyperparameters trained and optimized on football matches can be used to estimate the remaining time to concerts. Moreover, mixing in concert events in training improves the precision of the average football event estimate.},

It is therefore difficult for users to manually compare and aggregate it, and to re-construct the most probable course of future events. In this paper we approach a problem of automatically generating summaries of future events related to queries using data obtained from news archive collections or from the Web. We propose two methods, explicit and implicit future-related information detection. The former is based on analyzing the context of future temporal expressions in documents, while the latter relies on detecting periodical patterns in historical document collections. We present a graph-based visualization of future-related information and demonstrate its usefulness through several examples.},

While this information can prove crucial to understanding news stories and how events will develop for a given topic, there is currently no easy way to access this information. We propose a new task to address the problem of retrieving and ranking sentences that contain mentions to future events, which we call ranking related news predictions. In this paper, we formally define this task and propose a learning to rank approach based on 4 classes of features: term similarity, entity-based similarity, topic similarity, and temporal similarity. Through extensive evaluations using a corpus consisting of 1.8 millions news articles and 6,000 manually judged relevance pairs, we show that our approach is able to retrieve a significant number of relevant predictions related to a given topic.},

  abstract = {Providing the means for understanding natural language, or some groups of its realizations is one of the main goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI). For example, subfields of AI such as natural language processing ( NLP), or sentiment analysis (SA) focus on analyzing of speaker attitudes and emotions expressed in a sentence. A different kind of realization of natural language, which we focus on in this research, is predicting trends of future events from available language data. It is a challenging task, since it focuses on obtaining information on future unfolding of events from the provided instances of language behavior. To make the task feasible we narrowed the scope of our research to detecting and extracting sentences which refer to future events as potentially the most useful in prediction of future unfolding of events. Future reference sentences can contain information on the current state of events, or specific expert knowledge, and thus can be useful in future prediction. We propose a method for automatic extraction of future reference sentences from news corpora using semantic and morphological information. We also perform an experiment in which the sentences extracted with the proposed method are applied to predict future unfolding of a set of specific events.},

Experimental results show that our MTLS framework demonstrates high effectiveness and MTLS task can give bet-ter results than TLS.}
